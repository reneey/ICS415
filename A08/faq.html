    <strong>Troubleshooting Network Connectivity Issues</strong>
    <p>Please follow the steps below to diagnose network connectivity issues within Steam:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Test Your Router</strong></li>
      Before trying anything else:
      <br>Try bypassing your router by connecting your computer directly to your modem.
      <br>If the issue disappears after bypassing your router, please refer to the Using a Router with Steam topic for instructions on configuring your router.
      <br>Note: running your router in DMZ mode is not supported by Steam and may result in connection issues.
      <br>Additionally, wireless connections are not recommended for online gaming.  To ensure reliability, make sure you are using a wired connection to the internet while playing online.
      <br>
    <li><strong>Troubleshoot all Firewalls</strong></li>
      If you are installing Steam for the first time or Steam has recently been updated, a firewall may be preventing Steam from connecting to the Steam Network - even if Steam worked correctly before the update was applied.
      <br>
    <li><strong>Disable Background Applications</strong></li>
      Review the Programs Which May Interfere With Steam and reconfigure, disable or uninstall any programs which may be preventing Steam and Valve games from connecting.
      <br>
    <li><strong>Viruses, Trojans, Adware and Spyware</strong></li>
      Scan your computer for Spyware, Adware, and Viruses Interfering with Steam.
      <br>
    <li><strong>Power Cycle Your Network Hardware</strong></li>
      If the issue persists, unplug your modem and router, wait a few seconds, then plug them back in. Sometimes, these devices simply need to be refreshed.
      <br>
    <li><strong>Try Launching Steam using TCP</strong></li>
      Start Steam with the "-tcp" launch option.
    </ol>

  <dt>I've been VAC banned</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>What is VAC?</strong></p>
    If a user connects to a VAC-Secured server from a computer with identifiable cheats installed, the VAC system will ban the user from playing on VAC-Secured servers in the future.
    <br>While server admins may choose to ban specific players, server admins cannot VAC ban players. The VAC system is automated - contacting Steam Support to report cheaters is not necessary, nor will Steam Support act on any information provided.
    <br><br>The VAC system reliably detects cheats using their cheat signatures. Any third-party modification to a game designed to give one player an advantage over another is classified as a cheat or hack and will trigger a VAC ban. This includes modifications to a game's core executable files and dynamic link libraries.
    <p><strong>The following will not trigger a VAC ban:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Using chat programs like X-Fire</li>
    <li>System hardware configurations</li>
    <li>Updated system drivers, such as video card drivers</li></ul>
    Use only trusted machines to play on VAC-Secured servers - if you are not sure whether or not the machine you are using to connect to Steam may have cheats installed, do not play on VAC-Secured servers.
    <br><br>Use caution when installing any game modifications, such as scripts or custom skins. Only download custom content from trusted sources. Hackers sometimes maliciously disguise their cheats to cause others to get banned.

  <dt>I have low priority in Dota 2</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>I have been placed in the low priority matchmaking queue in Dota 2. What do I do now?</strong></p>
    All low priority matchmaking or communication bans will be automatically removed when they expire. There is no way to have a matchmaking ban removed early.
    <br>Steam Support cannot modify or remove your ban, regardless of the circumstances under which the ban was issued.
    <br>Low Priority Matchmaking or Communication Bans are not negotiable. If the system appears to be functioning incorrectly, submit a bug report to the Dota 2 Development Forums.
    <br>If this system is determined to have been functioning incorrectly, it will automatically be rolled back by our servers. Steam Support will never remove an individual account's Low Priority or Communication Ban.

  <dt>I have a ban or cooldown in CS:GO</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Competitive cooldown or ban</strong></p>
    I've been banned from competitive matchmaking in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. What do I do?
    <br>
    <br>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive bans are not negotiable. If an automated ban is determined to have been issued incorrectly, it will automatically be rolled back by our servers. Steam Support cannot modify a matchmaking ban. Steam Support cannot modify or reverse a matchmaking cooldown or ban, regardless of the circumstances under which it was issued.
    <p><strong>Competitive Cooldown</strong></p>
    As a new player, competitive wins will continue to cause a cooldown until you have completed enough games to calibrate your skill group.
    <p><strong>Why Was I Banned?</strong></p>
    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's competitive mode has a number of automated measures in place to ensure that every game is enjoyable for all players. A ban can be issued for any of the following reasons:
    <ul>
    <li>Abandoning a game</li>
    <li>Attacking teammates / teamkilling</li>
    <li>Abusing the kick system</li>
    <li>AFKing or otherwise not participating in a game that you have joined</li>
    <li>Cheating using a script, cheat application, or any other software designed to give you an unfair advantage.</li>
    </ul>
    A matchmaking ban will be issued regardless of whether or not an infraction was intentional.
    <p><strong>Technical Issues That Cause Disconnections or Abandons</strong></p>
    If you are encountering a technical or network issue that is causing you to be placed in competitive cooldown, we suggest that you troubleshoot that issue before attempting to play competitive game.
    <p><strong>The Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Overwatch System</strong></p>
    This game uses a community based anti-cheat and abusive behavior system called The Overwatch.
    <br>Steam Support cannot influence whether or not an account is accepted into the Overwatch system. Any Steam Support tickets requesting access to Overwatch will be ignored.
    <p><strong>Competitive Ban</strong></p>
    A competitive ban will be issued to any account that is caught cheating or displaying excessively damaging behavior via the text or voice communication systems by Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Overwatch system. This ban is not negotiable and cannot be removed, regardless of the circumstances under which it was issued.
    <p><strong>Bans through Steam Family Library Sharing Account</strong></p>
    Your Family Sharing privileges may be revoked and your account may also be VAC banned if your Steam Family Sharing Library is used by others to conduct cheating or fraud. In addition, VAC-banned games cannot be shared.
    <p><strong>VAC Bans Within Counter-Strike: Global </strong></p>
    VAC bans are not negotiable and will not be removed or modified on request. If a round of VAC bans is determined to have been issued incorrectly, they will be automatically reversed by our servers. Creating a Steam Support ticket will not cause your ban to be removed, regardless of the circumstances under which the ban was issued.

  <dt>I get the Failed to Start Game (Missing Executable) error</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>
