<h2>"Happy As The Sun"</h2>
<br>Whenever this world gets the best of me
<br>And it all goes wrong
<br>I count down the hours till the time we meet
<br>And I move along
<br>'Cause I know that when I see you I will be
<br>
<br>Happy as the sun, lighter than a feather
<br>Walking on the clouds when we are together
<br>Every day with you just keeps getting better
<br>The world's as it should be, when you are here with me
<br>Here with me
<br>
<br>Whenever you leave, my heart skips a beat
<br>Like it knows you're gone
<br>Unless you are here, I am incomplete
<br>Like an undone song
<br>Only you inspire the melody in me
<br>
<br>I'm happy as the sun, lighter than a feather
<br>Walking on the clouds when we are together
<br>Every day with you just keeps getting better
<br>The world's as it should be, when you are here
<br>
<br>How could I go wrong
<br>When you are here with me
<br>How could I be anything but smiling
<br>
<br>I'm happy as the sun, lighter than a feather
<br>Walking on the clouds when we are together
<br>Every day with you just keeps getting better
<br>The world's as it should be, when you are here with me
<br>
<br>Happy as the sun, lighter than a feather
<br>Walking on the clouds when we are together
<br>Every day with you just keeps getting better
<br>The world's as it should be, when you are here with me
<br>The world's as it should be, when you are here with me
<p></p>
